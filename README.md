This is a group project about a routing software with weather information for the start place and end place.
The input fields for the desired places do have auto completion feature.

Just in case if you decide to go through the commits to see the API keys: The API keys are inactive.
There is no need to try to use them. Unless you want to waste your own time, that is :)
